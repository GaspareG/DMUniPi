\section{Frequent patterns extraction with different parameters}

As we have a lot of categorical attributes with a lot of different values we don't have any frequent pattern with an high support. 

The firsts frequent itemsets appears when we set the minimum support to $40\%$, in this case we have a total of 34 itemsets, the first 10 are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item support: 49.55\%, items: ps-jun=0, ps-may=0
  \item support: 48.99\%, items: ps-apr=0, ps-may=0
  \item support: 48.44\%, items: sex=female, default=false
  \item support: 48.21\%, items: ps-jul=0, ps-jun=0
  \item support: 47.69\%, items: ps-sep=0, ps-aug=0
  \item support: 47.58\%, items: ps-aug=0, ps-jul=0
  \item support: 45.75\%, items: ps-apr=0, ps-jun=0
  \item support: 45.42\%, items: ps-jul=0, ps-may=0
  \item support: 45.31\%, items: ps-aug=0, ps-jun=0
  \item support: 44.81\%, items: ps-may=0, default = false
\end{enumerate}

In particular we have $9$ itemsets with default equals to false and none with credit default equals to true.

Choosing a minimum support of $30\%$ results in $131$ itemsets and half of them include the credit default equals to true.
