Each customer is modelled by a record in the dataset, which is composed by $24$ attributes that describes its personal data and its 

The analysis is composed in 4 phases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Semantical analysis and data manipulations for each customers (data cleaning, variables transformation, redundant variables, ...)
  \item Use of 3 clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) to group customers according to similarity properties in order to formulate hypotheses about customers credibility.
  
  \item verification of the hypotheses of the previous phase
  \item Classification of the customers
\end{itemize}
